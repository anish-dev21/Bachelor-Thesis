## Overview

This dashboard is designed for scalable, maintainable, and efficient monitoring and analysis of industrial sensor data. It provides interactive visualization, anomaly detection, and statistical analysis for time series data collected from a gas-fired hardening facility located at AGCO GmbH.

## Architecture

![Dashboard Architecture](https://github.com/anish-dev21/Bachelor-Thesis/blob/main/Dashboard%20Architecture.jpg)

The dashboard follows a layered architecture with four main components:

1. **Database Layer**: Utilizes Microsoft SQL Server (MSSQL) to store high-frequency sensor data from 98 sensors, partitioned monthly for efficient querying. The schema includes a timestamp and multiple sensor columns, with indexing for fast range queries. Data is filtered to remove null and zero values before processing.

2. **Backend Layer**: Built with Node.js and Express, the backend acts as an intermediary between the database and frontend. It exposes API endpoints for retrieving available sensor columns (`/columns`) and fetching time series data (`/data`). The backend applies preprocessing, error handling, and data resampling using a time-stratified sampling algorithm to ensure statistical integrity and computational efficiency. An additional `/anomaly-detection` endpoint provides anomaly detection and statistical metrics.

3. **Frontend Layer**: Developed in React, the frontend offers a user-friendly interface for sensor selection, time range specification, and interactive visualization. Key components include sensor selectors, date/time pickers, and Plotly-based charts. Global state is managed with Redux, and asynchronous operations are handled via Redux Thunks and Axios for API communication. The UI is responsive, adapting to various screen sizes using CSS and custom hooks.

4. **API Connection**: Axios is used for secure, asynchronous HTTP communication between frontend and backend. User actions trigger API requests, and the backend responds with processed, resampled data for visualization.

## Data Flow

1. **Sensor Data Collection**: Data is generated by OEM sensors at 10-second intervals.
2. **Data Storage**: MSSQL database stores data in monthly partitions.
3. **Backend Processing**: Node.js backend retrieves, filters, validates, and resamples data.
4. **API Transmission**: Data is sent to the frontend via REST API endpoints.
5. **Frontend Visualization**: React and Plotly display interactive scatter plots and metrics.

## Statistical Methods & Anomaly Detection

**Anomaly Detection System :**

The dashboard integrates multiple statistical techniques:

- **Percentile Baselines**: Operational states are classified using percentiles (P5, P10, P15, P85, P90, P95) to provide context-aware thresholds for anomaly detection and alerts.
- **Descriptive Statistics**: Includes mean, standard deviation, skewness, kurtosis, MAD, range, coefficient of variation, autocorrelation, linear trend analysis, and R-squared.
- **Anomaly Detection**: Combines Z-score, MAD, and mean deviation methods to identify outliers and abnormal operational behavior.
- **Change-Point Detection**: Implements binary segmentation with L1 cost function and moving average analysis to detect regime shifts and structural breaks in time series data.

## Data Resampling

The backend uses a time-stratified sampling algorithm to downsample large datasets, preserving statistical properties and temporal structure. This approach avoids the geometric bias of LTTB and ensures accurate baseline and anomaly detection.

## Visualization Features

**Dashboard Interface :**

![Dashboard Interface](https://github.com/anish-dev21/Bachelor-Thesis/blob/main/Dashboard_Interface.jpg)

- **Baseline Overlay Lines**: Percentile thresholds are shown as colored reference lines.
- **Anomaly Markers**: Detected anomalies are visualized with color-coded scatter points.
- **Trend Lines**: Linear regression lines with R² values indicate long-term changes.
- **Interactive Features**: Zooming, panning, and hover tooltips for detailed exploration.

## Performance Optimizations

- **Stratified Data Processing**: Reduces dataset size while preserving key characteristics.
- **Chunked Processing**: Prevents memory overload during large analyses.
- **Caching**: Baseline results are cached for efficiency.
- **On-Demand Queries**: Ensures near-real-time performance for multi-month datasets.

## Extensibility

The architecture supports future integration of machine learning models, predictive analytics, and additional sensor sources without major redesign, enabling scalable and intelligent industrial analytics.
